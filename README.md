Are you curious about delving into computer vision projects? Let's start with something fun and practical – detecting faces in real-time using Python and OpenCV.
In this mini-project, we'll utilize OpenCV, a popular library for computer vision tasks, to create a simple face detection system using your webcam.
Firstly, we import the necessary libraries – OpenCV and matplotlib for visualization. Then, we define a function called detect_faces(image) which takes an image as input and returns the same image with rectangles drawn around detected faces along with the count of faces found.
We utilize the pre-trained face detection model provided by OpenCV, known as Haar Cascade, to detect faces in the image. The detectMultiScale function helps us identify faces, and then we draw rectangles around them using cv2.rectangle.
After defining our function, we capture video from the webcam using cv2.VideoCapture(0). We continuously display the video feed in a window until the user presses 'q' to quit.
Once the user quits, we release the video capture object and close the window. Then, we detect faces in the last frame captured from the webcam using our detect_faces function.
Finally, we display the image with detected faces along with the count of faces using matplotlib.
This project serves as a simple introduction to the world of computer vision. With OpenCV's vast array of functionalities, the possibilities are endless – from facial recognition to object tracking and more.
